# Member<a name="class-member"></a>

Abstract base class representing a member in the OLAP multidimensional model. A Member is a specific point or value within a dimension that can be used for slicing, dicing, and filtering data in analytical queries. Members exist within hierarchies and levels, forming the navigational structure that users traverse when exploring data. Examples include [Time].[1997].[January], [Customer].[USA].[California], or [Measures].[Sales Amount]. Members can have parent-child relationships, properties, and various types including regular dimensional values, calculated formulas, or special system members like All members. This abstract class provides the foundation for both regular dimension members and measures, which are special members of the [Measures] dimension.

      <td colspan="5"><em>Boolean flag controlling whether this member appears in client tool member lists, XMLA metadata discovery, and cube browsers.

Uses standard formatting syntax for numbers, currencies, dates, and percentages (e.g., '#,##0.00', '$#,##0', 'yyyy-MM-dd', '0.0%'). This formatting is applied consistently across all OLAP clients and XMLA-compliant tools, ensuring uniform data presentation regardless of the client application being used.</em></td>
