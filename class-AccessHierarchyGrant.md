# AccessHierarchyGrant<a name="class-accesshierarchygrant"></a>

Provides sophisticated hierarchy-level access control that enables fine-grained security policies for dimensional navigation, member visibility, and aggregation behavior within a specific hierarchy. AccessHierarchyGrant represents one of the most powerful and complex aspects of the OLAP security model, supporting advanced scenarios including member-level restrictions, level-based access boundaries, dynamic security expressions, and rollup policy controls that determine how aggregate values are calculated when some members are inaccessible. This grant type is essential for implementing business-realistic security policies where users should see only specific portions of dimensional hierarchies based on their organizational responsibilities, geographic authority, product line ownership, or customer relationship management scope. The hierarchy grant manages the intricate balance between providing meaningful analytical access while enforcing business security requirements, handling complex scenarios such as ensuring parent members remain visible when their children are restricted, managing aggregation accuracy when partial data is accessible, and maintaining dimensional navigation coherence when security boundaries create gaps in the hierarchy structure. Hierarchy grants are particularly critical for large-scale enterprise deployments where dimensional hierarchies contain thousands or millions of members and where security policies must scale efficiently while maintaining query performance and providing intuitive user experiences for analytical navigation and exploration.
