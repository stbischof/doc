# TableQuery<a name="class-tablequery"></a>

Represents a direct query against a physical database table, providing the most common and straightforward data access pattern in OLAP applications. TableQuery serves as the foundation for fact table access, dimension table queries, and lookup table operations, enabling the OLAP engine to generate optimized SQL SELECT statements with appropriate filtering, grouping, and sorting. The query supports advanced performance features including custom WHERE clauses for data filtering, aggregation table specifications for pre-computed summaries, database-specific optimization hints for query tuning, and aggregation exclusion rules for controlling when summary tables should not be used. TableQuery is essential for both star schema and snowflake schema implementations, providing the direct table access needed for member loading, measure aggregation, and dimensional navigation.

      <td colspan="5"><em>Optional SQL WHERE clause expression that filters the table data before processing by the OLAP engine. This enables pre-filtering of large tables to improve performance, restrict data access based on security requirements, or limit analysis to specific business contexts such as current fiscal year data, active customers, or specific product categories. The WHERE expression is integrated into the generated SQL and can reference any columns available in the table, supporting complex filtering logic including subqueries, functions, and multi-condition expressions.</em></td>
