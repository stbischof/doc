# AccessCubeGrant<a name="class-accesscubegrant"></a>

Defines cube-level security permissions that control access to a specific OLAP cube and provide the foundation for more granular dimension, hierarchy, and member-level access controls within that analytical context. AccessCubeGrant operates as the primary business-domain security boundary, since cubes typically represent complete analytical subjects such as Sales Analysis, Financial Reporting, or Operations Management that align with organizational responsibilities and business processes. The cube grant establishes whether a role can access the cube's measures, calculated members, and associated dimensions, and when custom access is specified, it serves as the container for detailed dimension and hierarchy grants that precisely define which aspects of the cube's multidimensional space are accessible. This grant level is particularly significant because cubes encapsulate both factual data (measures) and dimensional context (dimensions and hierarchies), making cube-level security an effective mechanism for implementing role-based access control that reflects real-world business responsibilities and analytical requirements. Cube grants support sophisticated security scenarios including departmental isolation where each business unit has access only to cubes relevant to their operations, hierarchical access control where managers have broader cube access than their team members, project-based access where temporary access is granted to specific analytical domains, and compliance-driven restrictions where sensitive cubes containing regulated data are accessible only to authorized roles with appropriate clearance levels.
