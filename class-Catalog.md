# Catalog<a name="class-catalog"></a>

The root container of an OLAP schema that defines a complete analytical database. A Catalog represents a logical grouping of related cubes, dimensions, and data sources that together form a cohesive analytical model for a specific business domain or application. It serves as the top-level entry point for OLAP connections and contains all the metadata necessary to perform multidimensional analysis. The Catalog manages shared resources like dimension hierarchies, access roles, parameters, and database schema references, ensuring consistency and reusability across all contained analytical objects. In XMLA terms, this corresponds to a database or catalog that clients can connect to and browse.

By default, the measures dimension is named 'Measures', but this can be customized for localization or business terminology preferences. The measures dimension is a special system dimension that contains all the measures (metrics) available for analysis in each cube. This name appears in MDX syntax like [CustomMeasuresName].[Sales Amount] and in client tool dimension lists.</em></td>

Parameters enable runtime customization of schema elements, user-specific settings, and conditional logic in calculations. These parameters are available throughout the catalog for use in calculated members, named sets, security expressions, and custom formatting. Common uses include date ranges for time intelligence, user preferences, locale settings, and business rule toggles.</em></td>

Each cube represents a specific analytical perspective on the business data, containing measures for analysis and dimensions for slicing and dicing. Physical cubes map directly to fact tables and provide the foundation for analysis, while virtual cubes combine multiple physical cubes to create unified analytical views. At least one cube is required for a valid catalog.</em></td>

Named sets provide a way to define commonly used member groupings (like 'Top 10 Products', 'Current Quarter', or 'Key Customers') that can be referenced in MDX queries, calculated members, and reporting applications. These catalog-level named sets are shared across all cubes and provide consistency for common analytical concepts.</em></td>

Each role specifies what cubes, dimensions, hierarchies, levels, and members a user or group can access, along with the specific permissions (read, write, drill-through) for each resource. Roles can be combined to create complex security scenarios and support both broad organizational permissions and fine-grained data restrictions. These roles are enforced by the OLAP engine during query execution and metadata discovery.</em></td>

This provides a baseline security policy for the catalog, typically configured to allow basic read access to public data while restricting sensitive information. If not specified, the system may apply a built-in default role or require explicit role assignment for all connections. This is particularly useful for public reporting scenarios or development environments.</em></td>

Each DatabaseSchema represents a logical grouping of tables, views, and columns from one or more physical databases. The catalog can integrate data from multiple database schemas, enabling cross-database analysis and federated OLAP scenarios. These schemas provide the foundation for all cube queries and define the available tables and columns for fact tables, dimension tables, and lookup tables.</em></td>
