# Level<a name="class-level"></a>

Represents a group of members in a hierarchy, all at the same depth and sharing the same attributes and behavior patterns. Levels define the fundamental granularity layers within a dimension hierarchy that enable multidimensional analysis and navigation. For example, a Time dimension might contain levels like Year-Quarter-Month-Day, while a Geography dimension could have Country-State-City-ZipCode levels. Each level maps to specific database columns that provide member identification (key column), human-readable display (name column), localized captions (caption column), and custom sorting (ordinal column). Levels support various advanced features including member properties for additional attributes, custom formatters for display logic, data type specifications for proper SQL generation, uniqueness constraints for optimization, visibility controls for user interface management, and hiding conditions for handling ragged hierarchies and data quality issues. The level type attribute provides semantic meaning for specialized processing in time intelligence, geographic analysis, and business domain-specific operations.

These properties are fully accessible in MDX queries through property functions, appear in client tool member browsers, support filtering and sorting operations, can be used in calculated members and measures, and enable advanced analytical scenarios like property-based aggregations, conditional formatting, and drill-through operations.
