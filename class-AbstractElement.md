# AbstractElement<a name="class-abstractelement"></a>

The fundamental base class for all named elements in the ROLAP mapping model. This abstract class provides the essential identity, naming, and extensibility infrastructure that all OLAP schema components require. It establishes the core patterns for element identification, user-friendly naming, descriptive content, custom annotations, and documentation integration. Every major schema component (Catalog, Cube, Dimension, Hierarchy, Level, Measure, etc.) inherits from this class, ensuring consistent identity management and extensibility across the entire OLAP framework.

This ID serves as the primary key for object references, cross-references between elements, and internal system operations. The ID must be unique and eigther should follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., '_cube_sales', '_dim_product'),or may uses UUIDs. This identifier is used by the OLAP engine for object lookup, caching keys, and maintaining referential integrity during schema transformations.</em></td>

This field supports detailed explanations of the element's purpose, business meaning, usage guidelines, or implementation notes.

      <td colspan="5"><em>Display name for this element that appears in user interfaces, reports, MDX queries, and XMLA metadata. This should be a user-friendly name that business users will recognize and understand. Unlike the ID, this name doesn't need to be unique across the entire schema and can contain spaces, special characters, and international characters. For example, a dimension might have id='_dim_product' and name='Product Catalog'.</em></td>
