# AggregationTable<a name="class-aggregationtable"></a>

Abstract base class for pre-computed aggregation tables that dramatically improve OLAP query performance by storing pre-calculated summary data at various levels of granularity. Aggregation tables contain rolled-up measures and dimension keys that enable the OLAP engine to answer analytical queries from summary data rather than scanning millions of fact table rows. The aggregation system uses sophisticated matching algorithms to automatically select the most appropriate aggregation table based on query requirements, constraint compatibility, and rollup capabilities. Aggregations support superset matching where tables containing more detailed data than required can be used with additional rollup operations, and they handle complex scenarios including distinct count measures, foreign key relationships, and column mappings between fact and aggregation tables.

      <td colspan="5"><em>Boolean flag that controls whether string comparisons during aggregation table matching and name resolution should be case-sensitive or case-insensitive. When set to true, the aggregation matching algorithm will treat table names, column names, and string-based identifiers in a case-insensitive manner, which is particularly useful in environments with inconsistent naming conventions or when working with databases that have varying case sensitivity behaviors. This setting affects how aggregation patterns match table names, how column mappings are resolved, and how the OLAP engine correlates aggregation table elements with fact table and cube definitions. Case-insensitive matching can improve robustness in heterogeneous environments but should be used carefully to avoid ambiguous matches.</em></td>

The ID is used by the aggregation matching algorithm to track which aggregations have been evaluated, by logging and debugging systems to identify specific aggregation tables in performance analysis, and by administrative tools for aggregation management and monitoring. A well-chosen ID should be descriptive enough to identify the aggregation's purpose and scope while remaining concise for system efficiency, such as 'ProductMonthlySales' or 'CustomerRegionSummary'.</em></td>

Each AggregationMeasure specifies the measure name, the aggregation table column containing the pre-computed values, and the rollup type (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.) that determines how values can be further aggregated when rolling up to higher levels. This mapping is critical for enabling the OLAP engine to substitute aggregation table data for fact table scans, with measures like Sales Amount typically using SUM rollup, while distinct count measures require special handling to maintain accuracy across aggregation levels. The system supports complex measure scenarios including calculated measures, currency conversions, and weighted averages through appropriate rollup type specifications.</em></td>

These mappings enable the OLAP engine's aggregation matching algorithm to determine whether a given aggregation table can satisfy a query's dimensional requirements, support proper constraint propagation, and enable rollup operations when the aggregation contains more detailed levels than required by the query. Level mappings also support collapsed hierarchies where intermediate levels are skipped, caption columns for display purposes, and level properties for additional dimensional attributes stored in the aggregation table.</em></td>

This is particularly important for aggregations containing multiple measures with different data availability patterns, where each measure may have been calculated from a different number of source fact records due to null value handling, data filtering, or conditional aggregation logic. These specialized counts support advanced aggregation validation, debugging, and rollup accuracy verification.</em></td>
