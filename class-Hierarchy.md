# Hierarchy<a name="class-hierarchy"></a>

Abstract base class for OLAP hierarchies that organize dimension members into structured levels, enabling multidimensional analysis through drill-down, roll-up, and slice-and-dice operations. Hierarchies serve as navigational pathways through dimension data, organizing members from most detailed (leaf) to most aggregated (all member) levels. They support both explicit level-based structures and parent-child self-referencing relationships.

The unique key level defines the point in the hierarchical structure where member identification transitions from potentially shared keys at higher levels to guaranteed unique identifiers, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and supporting sophisticated analytical operations that require precise member targeting. This specification is essential for complex hierarchical structures where multiple levels may share similar identifiers but uniqueness is guaranteed only at specific granularity levels, supporting scenarios such as geographic hierarchies where city names may repeat across different states but become unique when combined with state-level context, product hierarchies where product names may be duplicated across different categories but become unique within category context, and organizational hierarchies where employee names may repeat across different departments but become unique within departmental context. The unique key level enables advanced OLAP functionality including precise member filtering where security policies or analytical constraints must target specific individual members, accurate drill-through linking where aggregated results must be traceable to specific underlying data records, and sophisticated member-based calculations where analytical logic must operate on unambiguously identified dimensional entities while maintaining performance and accuracy across large-scale enterprise analytical environments.</em></td>

When set to false, the hierarchy becomes invisible to standard user interfaces and metadata enumeration operations but remains fully functional for direct MDX references, programmatic queries, and system-level operations that explicitly reference the hierarchy by name. This visibility control is essential for enterprise OLAP deployments where hierarchical complexity must be managed to provide optimal user experiences, supporting scenarios such as technical hierarchies that serve internal calculation purposes but should not confuse business users, intermediate hierarchies that support complex analytical logic but are not intended for direct user navigation, deprecated hierarchies that remain functional for backward compatibility but should not appear in new applications, and specialized hierarchies that are designed for specific power-user scenarios or advanced analytical applications. The visibility setting enables sophisticated hierarchy management strategies including progressive disclosure where basic users see simplified dimensional structures while advanced users access complete hierarchical complexity, role-based hierarchy presentation where different user types see appropriate hierarchical views, and hierarchical versioning where new hierarchy implementations can be tested alongside existing structures without disrupting established analytical workflows and user experiences across enterprise business intelligence deployments.</em></td>

      <td colspan="5"><em>Reference to the database column that serves as the primary key for this hierarchy's main dimension table, establishing the unique identifier system that enables proper member identification, hierarchical relationships, and join operations across the dimensional model. The primary key column is fundamental to the hierarchy's data integrity and query performance, providing the basis for all member lookups, parent-child relationships, and cross-dimensional joins that enable multidimensional analysis. This column reference is essential for sophisticated OLAP architectures where hierarchical navigation, member filtering, and dimensional joining must operate efficiently across large data volumes and complex relational structures. The primary key supports advanced analytical scenarios including member-based security filtering where access controls are applied at the individual member level, drill-through operations that link aggregated analytical results back to detailed transactional data, dimension bridging where members from different hierarchies are correlated through key relationships, and temporal analysis where member keys enable tracking of dimensional changes over time while maintaining consistent analytical behavior. Enterprise implementations leverage the primary key for sophisticated caching strategies, query optimization patterns, and distributed analytical architectures where member identification must remain consistent across multiple data sources, processing nodes, and analytical applications while supporting high-performance query execution and maintaining data integrity across complex multidimensional analytical workloads.</em></td>

      <td colspan="5"><em>Reference to the Query object that defines how hierarchy members are retrieved from the underlying data source, specifying the SQL logic, table relationships, and data transformation rules required to populate this hierarchy with members from the dimensional database structures. The query reference establishes the critical link between the logical hierarchy definition and the physical data sources, enabling sophisticated data integration scenarios where hierarchy members may be sourced from complex table joins, views, stored procedures, or federated data sources. This query specification is fundamental to enterprise OLAP deployments where hierarchical data integration requires sophisticated SQL logic to handle normalized schemas, denormalized structures, temporal data management, and multi-source dimensional consolidation. The query supports advanced analytical architectures including slowly changing dimension handling where member evolution is tracked over time, dimensional bridging where hierarchy members are correlated across multiple fact tables, real-time dimensional updates where hierarchy membership changes are reflected in active analytical applications, and federated dimensional management where hierarchy members are sourced from distributed data systems while maintaining unified analytical behavior. Enterprise implementations leverage the query specification for performance optimization through indexed views, materialized query results, and intelligent caching strategies that ensure optimal hierarchy loading performance while supporting dynamic member updates, security-filtered member sets, and context-aware member populations that adapt to user permissions and analytical requirements across complex multidimensional business intelligence environments.</em></td>
