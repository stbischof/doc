# MeasureGroup<a name="class-measuregroup"></a>

A logical container that organizes related measures within a physical cube, providing grouping for measures that share common characteristics, business context, or data sources. MeasureGroup serves as both an organizational and metadata management mechanism, enabling better structure for complex cubes with many measures. For example, a sales cube might have separate measure groups for 'Revenue Metrics' (containing sales amounts, discounts, taxes) and 'Volume Metrics' (containing quantities, units, counts). Each measure group belongs to exactly one physical cube and contains one or more measures that are processed and displayed together in OLAP clients and XMLA metadata.

Each measure represents a quantitative fact that can be analyzed and aggregated in OLAP queries, such as sales amounts, quantities, costs, or counts. The measures share common grouping characteristics and are often related by business context or data source. At least one measure is required per measure group, and all measures inherit the group's organizational and metadata properties. Measures can be of various types including sum, average, min, max, count, or custom aggregations.</em></td>
