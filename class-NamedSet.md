# NamedSet<a name="class-namedset"></a>

Defines a reusable collection of dimensional members that can be referenced by name in MDX queries, calculated members, and other analytical expressions, providing powerful capabilities for creating sophisticated analytical logic that operates on predefined sets of business entities. NamedSet represents a fundamental building block for advanced OLAP applications where complex business concepts need to be encapsulated into reusable analytical components that can be consistently applied across multiple queries, reports, and calculations. This construct enables sophisticated analytical modeling scenarios including business segment definition where complex member selection criteria can be captured once and reused across multiple analytical contexts, temporal analysis where specific time periods or date ranges are defined as named sets for consistent time-based calculations, geographic groupings where complex territorial or regional member collections are standardized for comparative analysis, product categorization where sophisticated product groupings based on multiple attributes can be encapsulated for consistent reporting, and performance analysis where top/bottom performers or exceptional cases are defined through complex selection logic that can be applied consistently across different analytical perspectives. Named sets support dynamic evaluation where set membership can be recalculated based on current data values, static evaluation where set membership is fixed at definition time for performance optimization, and hierarchical composition where named sets can reference other named sets to create sophisticated nested analytical constructs. The named set framework integrates seamlessly with MDX query processing to provide efficient set evaluation, supports caching mechanisms for performance optimization of frequently used sets, and enables advanced analytical patterns including set-based filtering, cross-set comparisons, and dynamic set manipulation that forms the foundation for sophisticated business intelligence applications.

Display folders support hierarchical organization using forward-slash notation, allowing complex taxonomies that reflect business organization, analytical domains, or functional categories. This organizational capability is essential for large-scale OLAP deployments where numerous named sets need to be logically organized for efficient discovery and use by analytical users, business analysts, and report developers who need to quickly locate and understand available analytical building blocks.</em></td>

The formula provides the computational foundation for the named set, enabling complex business rules to be encapsulated in reusable analytical components that can range from simple member enumerations to sophisticated conditional logic that adapts to changing business conditions. Formula expressions support the full range of MDX capabilities including set operations, filtering functions, hierarchical navigation, attribute-based selection, and dynamic evaluation that enables named sets to serve as powerful analytical building blocks for advanced business intelligence applications.</em></td>
